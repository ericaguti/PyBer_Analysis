# PyBer_Analysis
##### Overview of the analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to create a summary of the ride-sharing data by city type. This analysis can help PyBer pinpoint the need for each city to either increase ridership or increase drivers. 

###### Results:
From the analysis, Urban cities are over saturated with drivers, thus impacting the fare for the driver to be less than the other city types. In Rural cities, the fare for the driver is the highest amongst the other city types. Additionally, the total number of drivers is the least compared to the other city types. Suburban cities data suggest the supply and demand are evenly balanced for riders and drivers. While keeping the average fare reasonable for the rider and the average far beneficial for the driver. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107595578/180945033-ea862349-3613-4275-8346-548e260b593e.png)

###### Summary:
In Rural cities, there were more demand for rides than available drivers to fulfill the request for a ride. Rural cities need to increase the number of drivers they have, an incentive program such as helping to lease or buying cars for drivers. 

In addition, Rural cities could benefit increase in ride demands. There could be a limited discount on rides fares to try to increase ridership. 

In Urban cities, they have almost double the number of drivers than need for rides. The company should offer a delivery service, that the drivers could do while waiting for request for rides. 

In Suburban cities, the balance between supply and demand seem to work out well for both parties. 

In conclusion, Urban cities seem to be over saturated with drivers, while in Rural cities could benefit with an increase of ridership and drivers. While Suburban cities seem to be have sustainable need for rides and drivers, that keep the ride fare reasonable and still benefitable fare for the driver.
